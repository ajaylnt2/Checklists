                                                     NODEJS WEB APPLICTION DEPLOYMENT - AZURE CLOUD APP SERVICE
                                                    *********************************************************************

                                                    LSI Web Portal:
                                                    --------------------


A) Web App Creation:
..................................

Step 1: Log in Microsoft Azure Account

Step 2: Click "App Services" category

Step 3: Click "Add" and in search type "Node Js Empty Web App" template.

Step 4: Click Create

Step 4: Fill the details
            App Name: lsiwebportal
            Subscription: Free Trail
            Resource Group: lsiRG
            App Service plan/Location: Choose your App Service Plan
            Application Insights: Based on requirement(default off)
           check "Pin To Dashboard"
           Click "Create"

Step 5: Click on your App Service after creation 
            Status: Running
            Url: http://lsiwebportal.azurewebsites.net
            Click browse-It should display a dummy page template with respective url.

Step 6: Go to Application Settings option in App Service and check the path in 
           Virtual Applications and directories level
             site\wwwroot\
             (It varies depending on the application)

Step 7: Here we have a chance to make a custom domain for our app service in "Custom Domain" category
            we can change as per the choice.

Step 8: Hence, a Web App is created successfully.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B) Database Creation:
.................................

Step 1: Go to SQL Databases category in Azure Portal and click "Add"

Step 2: Fill the details
            Database Name: LSIPortalDB
            Subscription: Free

                      Confirm Password: user@123
                     Location: Better choose a common location for all services
                     click "select"
            want to use SQL elastic pool: Not Now(useful in application with large db size)
            Pricing tier: useful in case of multiple database with a warehouse
            Click "Create" option.

Hence a Database with SQL Server created successfully
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C: Deployment:
.......................
(Using Source Control - Git Bash)

Step 1: Install Git Bash latest version in your local machine.

Step 2: Make a new folder and copy the source code into it and save it with the project name 
Ex: "LSIWebPortal"

Step 3: Then, open Git bash and give the path as root folder of latest project as
            just type:
                        cd desktop (it gives path to desktop)
                        cd LSIWebPortal (it extends to project folder)
                       
             then type,
                          git init (initialises git and it makes the project folder as your GIT repositry)

Step 4: Now go back to portal and make git repositry bind with your App Service.
for that,
           Azure Portal 
           -> Your App Service 
           -> Deployment Options
           -> Choose Data Source 
                  in this select option as "Local Git Repositry"
           -> Click "OK"

Step 5: Go to Deployment Credentials options and note down the 
             > User name
             > Password

Step 6: Go to Properties in your App Service and copy the git remote path 
            " Git Url"

Step 7: Back to Git for deployment process
            just type 
            git add '*' (this command will add all your local repositry to GIT)
            git commit -m " any related message" (which saves all the data in GIT repositry)
            git remote add azure remotepath (remote path will GIT url which we copied earlier)
            git push azure master
            here we will have the chance to use the GIT Credentials
            once the credentials are accepted
            Then, GIT will push the source code to App Service
             In other words Deployments process starts now.

If everything fine finally GIT will dispaly
"Deployment Completed Successfully".

Step 8: Go to your App Service and click "Browse"

Then it display the desired output with respect to the source code.

D) Database Updation (Local to Cloud):

Process A:
.................
Step 1: Open SQL Server Management Studio

Step 2: Open Object Explorer -> Click Connect
                                              Enter Details:
                                              server: (azure sql server name-> Ex; "lsisqlserver.database.windows.net")   
                                              Authentication: Sqlserver
                                              User Name: lsiuser (Azure Sql Username)
                                              Password: user@123 (Azure Sql Password)  
                                              Click "OK"
            if everything fine with DNS,Proxy restrictions and port accesses issues
            it connects to azure sql server and display the database.

Step 3: Just right click on respective database
           -> Tasks
           -> Deploy database to Microsoft Azure SQL Database
           Fill all the details
           If everything fine your local database will be directly migrated to Azure Cloud DB

Process B:
.................
Step 1: Connect to your local Sql Server with Local Database

Step 2: Make your Local DB with required data (Tables) and save it a part

Step 3: Right Click on Local Database
           -> Tasks
           -> Generate Scripts
           -> Fill all details with a new file pat on desktop and click OK
 then, the whole database will be converted as a single script file (Just like ur Database Backup)

Step 4: Then ,disconnect your Local server and reconnect with Azure Sql server with Cloud server credentials

Step 5: Right click on database which created earlier in cloud
            -> New Query
            -> Just paste the logic from script file which we saved earlier
            -> Then, click Execute

so, now the Azure Sql Database will resembles with the required project data.

Hence, the Database Migration is Successfully completed.

Summary:

If Database Migration done perfectly.
If Source code migration completed successfully through source conrol GIT..
The App Service should work as per the logic mentioned in the project...
