B: Deployment:
.......................
(Using Source Control - Git Bash)

Step 1: Install Git Bash latest version in your local machine.

Step 2: Make a new folder and copy the source code into it and save it with the project name 
Ex: "WAGES"

Step 3: Then, open Git bash and give the path as root folder of latest project as
            just type:
                        cd desktop (it gives path to desktop)
                        cd WAGES (it extends to project folder)
                       
             then type,
                          git init (initialises git and it makes the project folder as your GIT repositry)

Step 4: Now go back to portal and make git repositry bind with your App Service.
for that,
           Azure Portal 
           -> Your App Service 
           -> Deployment Options
           -> Choose Data Source 
                  in this select option as "Local Git Repositry"
           -> Click "OK"

Step 5: Go to Deployment Credentials options and note down the 
             > User name
             > Password

Step 6: Go to Properties in your App Service and copy the git remote path 
            " Git Url"

Step 7: Back to Git for deployment process
            just type 
            git add '*' (this command will add all your local repositry to GIT)
            git commit -m " any related message" (which saves all the data in GIT repositry)
            git remote add azure remotepath (remote path will GIT url which we copied earlier)
            git push azure master
            here we will have the chance to use the GIT Credentials
            once the credentials are accepted
            Then, GIT will push the source code to App Service
             In other words Deployments process starts now.

If everything fine finally GIT will dispaly
"Deployment Completed Successfully".

Step 8: Go to your App Service and click "Browse"

Then it display the desired output with respect to the source code. 

Summary:

If Source code migration completed successfully through Source Conrol GIT..
The App Service should work as per the logic mentioned in the project...
