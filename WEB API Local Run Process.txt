#Getting your code up and running on local machine.
----------------------------------------------------------------
It involves the processes like

1. Installation process
2. Software dependencies
3. Latest releases
4. API references

Seed project for angular apps using ES6 and webpack bundler.

- Run 'npm install' to install dependencies
- Run 'npm install auth0-js angular-lock angular-jwt angular-auth0@2.0.0-beta.2' to Install "auth0 lock dependencies"
- Run 'npm install angular-chart.js angular-nvd3' to Install "Chart dependencies"
- Run 'npm install angular-route@1.6.4 @uirouter/angularjs' to install "Route dependencies"
- Run 'npm install angular-storage ng-dialog angular-paging json-tree2 angular-xeditable' to Install other dependencies
- Run 'gulp serve' if any error occurs like "node-sass" go with 'npm rebuild node-sass' or other error related to npm then use  'npm update'
- Open Browser and check 
   "Url: http://localhost:3000"

#Running node js Server:
--------------------------------
- go to the folder 'srv' in the project.
- run 'node index.js'

#Running gulp server:
---------------------------
- go to the root folder in the project
- run 'gulp serve'

# Build & Debug:
----------------------

1) To create a ready production distribution package of the project please run 'npm run build'

2) If any error occurs related to Webpack go with 'npm install webpack'

3) After running build, generated files will be available at '/dist'(Distribution Folder - Server side usage)

4) 'dist' makes all the templates and scripts as of server side.

5) Change the root path from 'Client' to 'dist' and run the gulp as 'gulp serve'.

6) If the dist was perfectly build, then the server should connect and results a message
    "Webpack Compiled Successfully".
